<p>&emsp;This application targets small groups of people with the need to communicate with each other in absolute secrecy.</p>

<p>&emsp;Some unique capabilities include:
  <ul>
  <li>&emsp;Direct, one-to-one contact. The two users communicate directly with each other.</li><br />

  <li>&emsp;Completely server-less. There exists no server for either initiating, sustaining or monitoring the communication. The communication software resides exclusively in the devices themselves.</li><br />

  <li>&emsp;Both orally and in writing. The written communication is like old-style telex conversation: the typed characters are transmitted one by one and appear on the distant side as soon as they are typed. Both sides can type simultaneously.</li><br />

  <li>&emsp;No call registration. No record is held anywhere for the conducted communication.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>&emsp;The operating principle is quite simple: A common email account is used where each user’s device sends its public internet IP address. All devices of the group having access to this mailbox can connect to each other by using this information and a custom proprietary communication protocol.</p>

<p>&emsp;No central server is used, so nobody except the two communicating parties knows that they are communicating. This makes encryption unnecessary.</p>

<p>&emsp;The application runs both in iOS and Android devices.</p>
