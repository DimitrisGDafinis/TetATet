<p>&emsp;Tête à Tête uses a common email account as a basis, where all users' internet IP addresses are stored. All users of the group have access to this email account.</p>

<p>&emsp;It is recommended that a new account is created specifically for this application. So the messages created by the app will not mix with the users' other email messages. Any normal account in Gmail, Yahoo etc. is suitable.</p>

<p>&emsp;The details of this account are stored in the internal memory of the users' devices and are used for interconnecting the users' apps.</p>

<p>&emsp;Neither the account details nor the user’s activity are shared with anyone or any entity.</p>

<p>&emsp;The messages created by the users' apps can be manually deleted only by the user who created the email account.</p>

<p>&emsp;Messaging or chating is only possible between team members who have access to this email account. Tête à Tête is not aware of the fact, let alone of the content of the communication between the team members, therefore it can not be responsible for either.</p>

<p>&emsp;A group member can be blocked or unblocked by pressing their button.</p>

<p>&emsp;Use of Tête à Tête's copyrights, trademarks, logos, patents, and other intellectual property rights is not allowed, unless you have our written permission.</p>
