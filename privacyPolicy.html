<p>&emsp;Tête à Tête uses a common email account as a base, where all users' web addresses are stored. All users in the group have access to this account.</p>

<p>&emsp;It is recommended to create a new account specifically for this application. So, the messages created by the application will not be mixed with the user's other messages. Any normal account in Gmail, Yahoo etc. is suitable.</p>

<p>&emsp;This account information is stored on the internal memory of each user's device and is used exclusively to connect users' applications to each other.</p>

<p>&emsp;Neither account details nor user activity is shared with anyone or any entity.</p>

<p>&emsp;Messages created by user applications can only be deleted manually (via a browser) by the user who created the email account.</p>

<p>&emsp;Messaging or chatting is only possible between team members who have access to this email account. Tête à Tête is not aware of the fact, let alone of the content of the communication between the team members, therefore it can not be responsible for either.</p>

<p>&emsp;A team member who exhibits unacceptable behavior can be excluded from the rest of the team with just a simple click of their button. In the same way, it can be unblocked again.</p>
