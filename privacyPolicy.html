<p>&emsp;Tête à Tête uses a common email account as a basis, where all users' internet IP addresses are stored. All users of the group have access to this email account.</p>

<p>&emsp;It is recommended that a new account is created specifically for this application. So the messages created by the app will not mix with the users' other email messages. Any normal account in Gmail, Yahoo etc. is suitable.</p>

<p>&emsp;The details of this account are stored in the internal memory of the users' devices and are used for interconnecting the users' apps.</p>

<p>&emsp;The messages created by the users' apps can be manually deleted <b>only</b> by the user who created the email account.</p>

<p>&emsp;Neither the account details nor the user’s activity are sent anywhere.</p>
